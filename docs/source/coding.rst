Coding style
============

Unit names in lower case::

    package_name::unit_name.

Predefined simple types in lower case::
    
    int, cardinal.

Classes, structs, custom types in CamelCase::

    GuidData = Struct, String = class, Utf8Sym = struct

Methods and procs start from lower case, continue in camel::

    proc stringFromInt(a: int)

TODO:

- forward declarations

For better readability for classes and single pass parsing make language require
forward declarations.

type 

Child = forward class
Parent = class child: Child end_class

Child = base_class parent: Parent end_class


forward proc myproc(a, b: int): int 

proc myproc return a+b end_proc

proc myproc(a, b: int): int return a+b end_proc

Forward declarations take all arguments, annotations etc. If forward declaration
is used then the implementation must not specify anything, only proc ... end_proc



- var a : type -> add symbol table item with resolved 'type' (i.e. bypass alias)

+ 'type' cannot define alias for array, enums etc., only enum, struct, class
because arrays are mutually compatible anyway.

+ decouple CompilationUnit etc.
- Errors handling (get from mycalc1)
- rethink types storage (e.g. MethodWithBody), prefer Enum with Data, rather
  than classes per type


- evaluate expressions during second (semantic) pass both type and values
to calculate static_if's

- check for predefined annotations, unknown annotations trigger error

- track scopes when parsing declarations, no procedure calls are possible
when defining globals constants/vars

- check for double getters and setters for properties

- check for unnecessary body for abstract methods, external procs and omission
otherwise
